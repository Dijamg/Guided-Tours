 This is a content creation website for an Android navigation application which provides guided tours for visitors of Aalto university. With this website we can create new tours and point of interests and push them to our Android application. This website is made fully by me.
 
 Refreshing site crashes it since this version uses React Routers without backend.
 
 /* THIS VERSION DOES NOT COMMUNICATE WITH OUR ANDROID APPLICATION FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. THIS COMMUNICATES WITH A MOCK JSON SERVER. AUTHENTICATION IS ALSO NOT DONE IN THIS VERSION */
