This is a content creation website for an Android navigation application which provides guided tours for visitors of Aalto University. With this website we can create new tours and point of interests which we can then push into our Android application. This website is made fully by me.
 
It takes few seconds for all the buildings and tours to load. This website sends all the submited files to a firebase storage, so dont submit stuff which you don't want to end up there.
 
 Refreshing the site while being at /POIs or /Tours endpoints crashes it since this version uses React Routers without backend.
 
 /* THIS VERSION DOES NOT COMMUNICATE WITH OUR ANDROID APPLICATION FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. THIS COMMUNICATES WITH A MOCK JSON SERVER. AUTHENTICATION IS ALSO NOT DONE IN THIS VERSION */
